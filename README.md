# JavaScript Wave Function Collapse

A crude implementation of WFC using the SimpleTiledModel in JavaScript.

I understand that this execution of WFC is not the most efficient but my main goal was to prove that I could do it in the first place.


If you want to try this out yourself, then clone the repository and run
```
npm install
```
and then run the following command in one terminal
```
npm run start
```
and this one in another
```
npm run build:watch

---or---

npm run build:dev
```

## Credits

This algorithm was inspired by the idea of superposition and entropy from Quantium Mechanics (way above my head) but was explained to me by a youtube channel called The Coding Train's most recent video about Wave Funtion Collapse. Thank you very much for that person to have helped me understand the idea behind it and it's implementation.
